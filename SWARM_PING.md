Design and scaffold a v3 DevinSwarm framework that co-exists with the current stack. Follow CODEx runbook conventions, derive lessons from v1/v2, but create new v3-specific docs, state classes, workers, prompts, etc. Never modify or rename existing v1/v2 files until v3 is stable-work in parallel directories and document a cutover plan.
